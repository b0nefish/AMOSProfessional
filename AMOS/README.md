# About official AMOS Professional Source Code repository.
> On 2020.04.26, François Lionet officially released Amos Professional source code on his own GitHub repository under MIT Licence type as it was initially planed by himself many years ago.<br>
> The link to get access to the official AMOS-Professional-Offical repository Source Code is here : https://github.com/Francaoz/AMOS-Professional-Official<br>
> The original AMOS-Professional-Official licence (in the README.md is included at the end of this file.<br>

# About AMOS Professional AGA support.
> The project that did initially takes the name "Amos Professional X" was stopped. With the official release of Amos Professional under MIT Licence, I have reopened this project. As some people asked me I cannot do what I want with the "Amos Professional" name (even if I think the MIT Licence allow me to do the X change in the name), I decided to remove the X and simply add 'AGA' as a natural name to mean that the main goal of this project is to add AGA support to François Lionet AMOS Professional.<br>
AGA is not a name changing, but just an information to help finding easily AGA support for AMOS Professional repository.

> I have much respect about the huge amount of work François did to create AMOS and AMOS Professional but, for the moment, and in respect to the MIT Licence terms capabilities (source : https://github.com/Francaoz/AMOS-Professional-Official/blob/master/LICENSE seen in the GitHub box about MIT Licence "A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code." ) and not restricted by licence information added by François, I consider that improving AMOS Professional with AGA support is a larger work as it require me to makes many changes in many components of the AMOS Professional engine (copper list, sprites, bob, iff/ilbm, load/save datas, internal structures, etc.).<br>
With these, I prefer not release the source code for the moment.<br>
Source code will probably be released for "educational purposes" when the project will be finished (and more especially because it was initially planed with the AMOS Factory team to include this major update inside their major updates, and I want to respect this engagment with the AMOS Factory team)

> The current repository now contain the latest version that was done under Amos Professional X, originally forked from marc365 repository, from where François Lionet also based his official release.<br>

>It is a restart of the whole project concerning AGA support, and as it is a "free time" development (not commercial), I can promise nothing about future releases/updates dates.

>I hope that everything will be ok with François Lionet now as I don't want to steal his work. Just protect mine. I hope he can understand this.

Regards,
Freddix


#Original AMOS-Professional-Official Licence copy from README.md file :

### Welcome to the official AMOS Professional source code repository.

You will find in this repository the entire source code of AMOS Professional, as it was on my machine at the end of 1993 when I decided to switch to PC and create Klik and Play with my partner Yves Lamoureux.

This source-code is published under the MIT licence, which means you can do anything you want from it as long as the copyright notice is present in both the modified source code and the boot screen of the application. I have unfortunately forgotten how you can compile it and would appreciate to receive an extra documentation, if you have managed to compile, so that I can include it is this readme. Do not hesitate to contact me by mail about this.

I am delighted to see that this code, that was made at a very special moment of my life, is still alive 30 years after it was written. I cannot wait to discover what you will do with it. Be creative!

Please note that I will not answer to any technical questions as I do not remember how it works and all this is for me the past. Even if the Amiga is and will always be in my heart, my focus is the future and this future is called AOZ.

Francois - fl@aoz.studio

This distribution is based on the repository created by marc365. https://github.com/marc365/AMOSProfessional

I have added the MIT licence headers to all the sources. If you know about a newer of better version of the source-code, do not hesitate to send it to me by mail, I will gladly update the repository.

Thank you Marc365! I have included your readme after this intro.

This repository is 68k Assembly and unique in design. It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

This release is as-is and doesn't contain any installation or demos.

It's really fun and will test your "actual" programming skills!

# AMOS Professional

based on the original 68000 source code by François Lionet (Thank you!)

# History
Some years ago there was discussion of re-development, but the work mentioned in [this article](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html) was not made public, any collaborative efforts have disappeared. An archive was made available at a later date but was partially incomplete and difficult to build - this project fixes the build problems, but has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.

# AMOS PRO goes Public Domain!

> [01 dec 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20130530022407/http://www.pianetaamiga.it)
In occasion of Pianeta Amiga 2012, Pietro Ghizzoni, current owner of AMOS Pro sources after Francois Lionet ceased development, has kindly agreed to release them as Public Domain. You can download the full package in advance from this link. Sources will be also put on Aminet in the next days.

# AMOS present and future

> [pre Public Domain ?](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html)
As you know some months ago i've obtained the AMOS sources... during these months I've spent my time learning the AMOS internal functions and structures, in order to upgrade it and develop the new AMOSPro V3... but I've to say that my projects have changed a lot during this period. My original idea was to upgrade/expand it, add AGA support and most of all to make AMOS more OS friendly! but when I examined the sources some problems have arisen...
