# History
Some years ago there was discussion of re-development, but the work mentioned in [this article](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html) was not made public, any collaborative efforts have disappeared. An archive was made available at a later date but was partially incomplete and difficult to build - the [marc365 project](https://github.com/marc365/AMOSProfessional) fixed the build problems, but has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.

# Amos Professional X

This project started from the Marc365 version of Amos Professional sources. Amos Professional X has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.
