Amos Professional X - Binay Releases only (No AmosPro Source code included)


# About AmosProfessionalX-Releases repository
This repository is created to allow everyone to download for free, the latest changes done to the "Amos Professional X" project.
The "Amos Professional X" project is an attemp to bring AGA support to Amos Professional in a native way.
That mean that you can use AGA graphics directly using natives Amos Professional commands such as : Screen Open, Colour, and more...
Don't forget that is a project under development. That mean that some Amos Professional (untested) may have been broken by aga updates, etc..

# Report issues
If you encounter a problem, you can send me an email directly to cordierfr(at)wanadoo(dot)fr and I'll try to fix if. Don't forget to provide a small .AMOS sample with all required files to reproduce the issue you've found.

Regards,
