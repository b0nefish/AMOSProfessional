BMOD player. (Loader and player)

Usage:
	bm <bmod-module>

Note: Needs KickStart 2.0+. Sorry 1.3 users, you should upgrade.

Note 2: Bm doesn't use XPK, so if you want to load XPK-packed files,
unpack them first or use IPatch or similar runtime-unpacker.

Note 3: The player is coded entirely with assembler and the loader
	is coded with AmigaE 2.1b.
