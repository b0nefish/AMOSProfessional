Author:       Andreas Barth (based on verson 1.1 by Michael Henke) 
Type:         mus/play
Version:      1.3
Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 2.0.4
Distribution: Aminet

$VER: mhimdev.library 1.3 (Mon 03-Oct-2011)



 #features
   mhimdev.library is a driver for the MHI system. It doesn't support any
   specific MPEG audio hardware decoder directly, instead it sends the data
   to an mpeg.device driver. It's an "interface converter" or "wrapper" that
   allows you to use your existing MPEG hardware and drivers in applications
   which support the new MHI interface only. (such as AmigaAMP)

   This program is free software, full source code included.



 #requirements
   -AmigaOS V37+
   -MPEG audio hardware decoder with mpeg.device support
    (eg. CD32 FMV, Delfina DSP, MAS Player, Melody and possibly some more)

   -developed on A1200 - OS3.1/68030+882@40MHz/16MBFastRAM/Delfina1200DSP
   -tested with delfinampeg.device 1.2 and AmigaAMP 2.9-beta1
   -tested with AmigaAMP 2.24



 #changes since previous release
    -fixed a crash when playing songs in a row using a device which replies the play
     command immediately (like delfinampeg.device and possibly others as well)



 #reason for version 1.2
   I used the mhi_mdev.library and noticed a problem with the MPEGCMD_PLAY.
   The library uses DoIO to send it to the device, which I think is not
   compatible with the Commodore standard, where the command instead will
   be aborted later.
   I asked Michael to change this. But he can't do this any more. As source
   is available, I did it.
   Now, the MPEGCMD_PLAY is issued with SendIO and later aborted. This should
   not cause any problems with mpeg devices that already worked with the
   mhi_mdev.library. But now also the devices that wait for the MPEGCMD_PLAY
   to be aborted (if there are any), which is I think so according to the
   Commodore documentation, will also work.



 #how to use
   1) install library
        > makedir LIBS:MHI
        > copy mhimdev.library LIBS:MHI/

   2) configure library
      two parameters must be set in the environment variable MHIMDEV
        -name of your specific mpeg.device
        -unit number (usually 0, but may be different for your hardware)
      example from my system:
        > setenv MHIMDEV delfinampeg.device 0
        > copy ENV:MHIMDEV ENVARC:

   3) configure application(s)
      at the moment only AmigaAMP uses the new MHI interface.
        -start AmigaAMP prefs program
        -go to System page
        -select engine: MHI-Driver
        -select driver: LIBS:MHI/mhimdev.library

   4) have fun. ;-)



 #known problems
   -MHI defines a few extensions that are NOT SUPPORTED by the mpeg.device
    standard so they are simply ignored. Currently they are:
      -tone control (bass/mid/treble)
      -crossmixing control (stereo channel separation)

   -mhimdev.library was written according to the mpeg.device specification so
    it should work with all MPEG decoders which support this interface.
    Due to lack of other hardware decoders I can test it only with my Delfina
    using delfinampeg.device. I would like to know what other mpeg.devices are
    used with this MHI driver. (please report successful usage, too)
