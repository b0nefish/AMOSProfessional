03 Mar 2004: 7th release
- Added some more compiler options to squeeze out more speed.
- Fixed cases where buffersize would be wrong for apps that try to reset it to
  another value through the hook (this is not recommended however, as I try to
  force a recommended minimum (and absolute minimum is 2880 bytes (not counting
  freeformat which can be upto 5760 bytes per frame (perhaps even more))))...
- Now preserves A4, might fix some apps.
- Reenabled -fschedule-insns2 for PPC since new asm doesn't trigger bug, gained
  whopping 15% speed (with new asm)... ;)
- More compatibility tweaks, hopefully SongPlayer is less fuzzy about files now.
- Updated to libmad 0.15.1 with new IMDCT for Layer3,
  should increase speed *and* accuracy! ;)
- Added support for LAMEtag, using ReplayGain info when decoding.

23 Jun 2002: 6th release
- Fixed prebuffering to properly handle large ID3v2 tags.
- Minor cleanups.
- Enabled libmad PPC-asm optimization (didn't work before due to -fschedule-insns2 bug).
- Added fast bzero() support-function, and favoured that over memset(..,0,..).
- Added StormC/WarpOS project/source and binary (done by Jarmo Laakkonen).

07 Dec 2001: 5th release
- Optimized PCM routine, 20% speedup.
- Inlined some of the supporting functions for efficiency.
- Increased minimum buffer and mempool size.
- Override check_mpeg if whole file fits in buffer without finding sync.
- Improved SongPlayer (and other bad apps that pass library base across tasks)
  workaround, should no longer crash when appending playlists while playing.

17 Nov 2001: 4th release
- Updated to libmad 0.14.2.
- Fixed VBR bitrate calculation bug.
- Enabled slight speedup for .040 version.
- Now ignores CRC errors on quality-level <= 1 (thus making mp3s with
  corrupt CRC headers playable).
- Improved PowerUP dispatcher, the .ppc version is now fully multithreaded.

10 Nov 2001: 3rd release
- Improved safety.
- Fixed the callback hook for 68k.
- Added automatic stack-swap on complex function-entrypoints, this should
  (finally?) fix applications like AMPlifier, Prayer and HippoPlayer...

07 Nov 2001: 2nd release
- Allow pcm[1] to be unallocated, implying mono decoding.
- Make a copy of the MPEGA_CTRL structure instead of assuming it to remain
  allocated and valid after MPEGA_open() (fixes DeliTracker and AMPlifier
  (and Prayer?)).

02 Nov 2001: Initial release
- Fully working API
