It's a dream of worlds in motion
And another place in time
I guess I'm feeling lost in
The home I thought was mine


It's a universal notion
Life is just a battlefield
Open your heart for someone
Nothing is revealed


Fly away - You can leave it all behind you
I'm on my way to find you
And I'll soon be flying too
Fly away - We can fly away together
I'm talking 'bout forever
This is all we gotta do:
Fly away ...


It's a tangled-up emotion
Will you stay or will you go
I am the one to count on
If only you could know


Fly away - You can leave it all behind you
I'm on my way to find you
And I'll  soon be flying too
Fly away - We can fly away together
I'm talking 'bout forever
This is all we gotta do:
Fly away ...
