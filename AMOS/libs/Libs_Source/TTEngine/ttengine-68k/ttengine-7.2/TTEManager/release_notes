v1.2 (08.01.2005)

  - Added global settings for cache size and global gamma.
  - Fixed deadlock when redrawing font settings window after depth arranging.
    This deadlock happened at least on MorphOS systems (probably classic systems
    were affected too if in smart refresh mode).
  - Monospaced fonts are marked as such automatically in the database.

v1.1a

  - Added translations: Polish (by me), French (by Jerome Chesnot), Hungarian
    (by Márton Dósa) and German (by Dieter Beck).

v1.1 (05.01.2003)

  - TTManager now reads and writes CACHELIMIT parameter in ttengine.database (no
    GUI for editing yet, you should edit it by hand for now). See TTEngine 6.0
    release_notes for detalis about limiting cache size. Default cache limit is
    512 kB. You can change it using a texteditor, TTManager will preserve the
    value.
