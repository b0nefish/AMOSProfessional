overview
--------------------------------------

  neuralnet.library is an amiga shared library. it provides a
  lean and simple programming interface for the use of neural
  networks.
  
  neuralnet.library allows creation of backpropagation networks.
  this is one of the simplest and most common network types.
  
  there are many possible applications: use it for optical
  recognition, mouse-movement detection, analysis of complex
  number series, result predictions, and 'intelligent'
  user interaction.
  
  keep in mind that the library only provides the general
  implementation of backpropagation networks. the most complex
  and demanding part of the work is to parametrize the input
  and output. neural networks require intellectual assistance.
  
  this package contains a simple manual that covers some of the
  basic theory and how to use the library in daily applications.
