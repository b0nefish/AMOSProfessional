1. Legal Stuff
--------------
This software package is written and copyright © 1997-1999 by Georg Hörmann.
Changes and updates from December 1999 to May 2001 are copyright © 1999-2001
by  Alex  van  Niel.  Changes and updates from June 2001 to October 2001 are
copyright © 2001 by Jan Erik Olausen.  Releases since October 2001 are again
copyright © 2001-2003 by Georg Hörmann.

No parts of this software package may be altered by any means (this includes
editing, reprogramming, crunching, resourceing etc.), except archiving.  The
author  is in no way liable for any changes made to any part of the package,
or  consequences  thereof  as  he is in no way liable for damages or loss of
data directly or indirectly caused by this software.

This  software package is FREEWARE for non-commercial use.  Commercial users
or  distributors must gain permission of the author first.  Neither fees may
be  charged  nor  profits may be made by distributing this software package.
Outside  a single machine environment, you are not allowed to reproduce only
parts of the package, but you have to copy it completely.

2. Installation
---------------
The xvs.library contains all the virus recognition and removal code that was
formerly included in VirusZ.  This step has been taken for one major reason:
VirusZ,  Virus_Checker,  Virus_Executor and all the other antivirus software
can be updated quickly without releasing the whole packages every time a new
virus appears.

So simply install the xvs.library from this archive to your LIBS:  drawer to
get  100%  protection against the latest viruses.  You can either copy it by
hand or use the installer script written by David Crawford.

NOTE  #1:   To  detect  ALL  viruses  inside  crunched  and/or linked files,
xvs.library must be used together with the xfdmaster.library (available from
Aminet  or  the  VHT-Denmark  homepage)!  I therefore strongly recommend the
installation of this library too.

NOTE  #2:  If xvs.library detects that it might have been modified (maybe by
some new virus?), it will inform you with an alert and tell you what to do!

3. PGP Signatures
-----------------
To be able to check if the library in this archive really came straight from
the  author,  you  can use my public key with the .sig files in the archive.
If  you  are  not sure or do not trust the included key, then you can always
request  an  original  copy straight from me (by email, see below) or get it
from the VHT-Denmark homepage.

4. Some Words to Amiga Programmers
----------------------------------
As  you  may have noticed, I don't have enough time at the moment to add all
the features that users desire to my viruskiller VirusZ.  On the other hand,
there  are  a  lot  of  talented coders out there who might have the time to
write  a really good viruskiller environment, but don't have all the viruses
to  add  them  or  are  not willing to torture themselves with analysing all
those (old) little bastards.

That's  the  point  where xvs.library comes in.  With this library you get a
powerful  tool  to  detect  and  eliminate  all sorts of viruses.  Currently
xvs.library offers you the following functions:
a. Detect bootblock viruses and install clean bootblocks instead.
b. Detect manipulated disk sectors and repair them if possible.
c. Detect infected files and repair them if possible.
d. Scan all memory regions for active viruses and remove them if any.

All you have to do (and that's still enough, believe me ;-) is to submit the
files,  sectors  or  bootblocks  you want to have tested to xvs.library.  In
other  words:   You design an outstanding GUI with all the features that are
required  nowadays (ARexx, Locale, etc.) and I support you with my antivirus
knowledge of the last 12 years!
