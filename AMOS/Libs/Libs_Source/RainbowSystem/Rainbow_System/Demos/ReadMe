Three little demonstrations of RainbowSystem!



1) Demo, show all graphic functions of the 'rainbow.library'. You can  find  the
complete source of this example in the drawer "Developer"

2) PictureView, a clone of Multiview (but show only pictures!). Try  to  open  a
big number of pictures and enjoy the high quality of the rendering! :))
To scroll the pictures, just click the left mouse button  into  the  window  and
move the mouse! And take a look to menus!

3) ImageReq, a little (unfinished) side project, which show the great  power  of
RainbowSystem!


After using this programs, try to change driver  in  the  RainbowManager...  and
dreams the result if you use the registered drivers! :-)))


PS: PictureView and ImageReq needs JFIF Codec to show JPEG pictures!
