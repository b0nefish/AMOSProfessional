   Triton  is  an  object  oriented  GUI creation system for AmigaOS.  Triton
makes  it much easier to create good looking graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
than GadTools, BOOPSI or other systems.  Complicated things like resizability
of  windows  or  a fully font sensitive gadget layout are handled entirely by
Triton.

   Furthermore  Triton  GUIs  can  be  configured  by  means of a Preferences
editor,  including  e.g.  a screen and a window manager  for most comfortable
GUI management.

   Both,  users and programmers, should have this user archive which contains
the  main  Triton  system  required by any Triton user.  A separate developer
archive  for  programmers  of  Triton applications is available, too.  If you
have  already  obtained the developer archive, simply unpack it into the same
directory  as  the  user archive and everything will fit together into a full
Triton distribution release.

   For  a  demonstration  of  some  Triton  features, simply double click the
`Demo' icon in the main directory of this distribution drawer.  It will start
the main Triton demo without having to install Triton first.  Be sure to have
a look at the documentation (`Docs/Triton.guide' or `Docs/Triton.dvi'), too.
