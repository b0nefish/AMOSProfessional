INCLUDES README

In this directory you'll find the required includes to use chunky.library
with your C compiler.  Other languages will need modifications, but you can
use these as a basis for other languages (e.g. Blitz Basic, etc.).

Just copy these directories (and their contents) to your C include
directory (include: under SAS/C).

Then to use them in your application...

...
#include <libraries/chunky.h>
#include <pragmas/chunky_pragmas.h>
#include <proto/chunky_protos.h>
...
struct Library *ChunkyBase;
...
main()
{
  ...
  if(ChunkyBase = OpenLibrary("chunky.library", 3))
  {
    ...
    // Use chunky.library routines...
    ...
  }
  if(ChunkyBase) CloseLibrary(ChunkyBase);
}
...

... or see your C compiler manual if there are different directories,
invocations, etc.

This library was developed under StormC v3 so other compilers may need
modification.
