 chunky.library EXAMPLES
 -----------------------

Yes, I finally got off my arse and did some examples for using
chunky.library.  Ever since I released V3 of the library, I've numerous
e-mails and comments on IRC saying "how do you use it".  Well, here we go.

     Basics (dir)

Start here.  The Basics directory shows how to do the real basic stuff with
the library, e.g.  allocating ChunkyPort's, bunging it on a window and
other trivial things.

     Colours (dir)

These examples in the Colours directory show how to use all the new-for-V4
colour palette commands.

     Drawing (dir)

The examples here show how to use the drawing functions - CHK_Draw(),
CHK_DrawEllipse(), CHK_RectFill(), etc.

     Text (dir)

Getting to the juicy commands, this directory holds the key to using the
text routines.

     Effects (dir)

Examples here show how to do some neat effects with the library.  Although
the effects are few, they are still powerful commands.  CHK_SimpleScale(),
CHK_Scroll(), etc.  are shown here.

     _shared (dir)

Various code modules and data files used by various examples.

Executable versions of these demos are found in the user archive.

Note that all the code in the examples directory is public domain, but
remains without warranty.  Some examples have blatently cut corners so if
they error, your machine may go down too.  You have been warned - use these
examples are your own risk!

These examples are for educational purposes only and do not reflect the
quality of Rosande Limited's commercial titles.

Please visit the chunky.library support site for the latest developments,
and Aminet when it works.
