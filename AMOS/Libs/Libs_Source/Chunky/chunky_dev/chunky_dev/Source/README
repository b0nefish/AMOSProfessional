Note that from 3.21+, library source code is  private, available on
request.  See the other documentation for information on obtaining it.

You'll find the C2P and P2C code used in the library, which is public
domain.  Feel free to modify.

Fancy converting these C2P/P2C routines to PPC?  E-mail me:
