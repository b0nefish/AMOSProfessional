 chunky.library v4.0

 Routines to create, render and delete chunky graphics data.
 Based on (not so :) really buggy code written previously by
  pernathw@cu-muc.de (Wanja Pernath).
 New improved version by Andrew 'Oondy' King.
 Version 2.00+ is (c) 1999 Rosande Limited, all rights reserved.
 The original v1.0 chunky.c sources can be found in Aminet:dev/c.
 Version 3.00+ is now a shared library.
 Version 4.00+ is developed by oondy and Wanja, although now entirely
  maintained by oondy.

 chunky.library requires 020, OS3.0, and AGA/CGFX

 1.0 - inital thing done by Wanja.
 2.0 - loads of bugs fixed by oondy
     - added ChooseHardwareMode()
 2.1 - added DrawChunkyChunky()
     - all chunky stuff now contained in a single object file
2.11 - added some more safer checks now for boundries
2.12 - DrawChunkyChunky() 75% faster now.
2.13 - added DrawChunkyChunkyArea()
2.14 - fixed minor bug in FreeChunky() (now safe if cp == NULL)
2.15 - fixed clipping bug in DrawChunkyChunkyArea()
2.16 - ChooseHardwareMode() failed on gfx boards!
 2.2 - MAJOR UPDATE...  transparent support for Picasso96/AGA (cgfx coming 
       soon)
2.21 - doh.. removed p96 and used cybergraphics instead
2.22 - fixed several bugs with cgfx support (InsertChunky() now inserts)
     - tidyed up a few routines by removing duplicate code
2.23 - added code to read and write chunkyport structs+data to disk
     - changed how chunkyports are allocated and freed
2.24 - fixed bug in CHK_ReadChunkyPort()
     - added routine to read chunkyport data from a memory location
     - fixed massive bug in CHK_InsertChunky() (rpa8() was being an arse)
2.25 - added optional colour palette support (256 colours only)
2.26 - file-based chunkyports are now compressed (uncompressed still 
       supported)
2.27 - added CHK_DrawChunkyTiled()
 3.0 - NOW A SHARED LIBRARY!
     - removed CHK_Read/WriteChunkyPort() and compression support (no point)
     - removed CHK_SPrintF() (anyone use this?)
     - fully documented now
     - user and developer archives (2nd public release)
 3.1 - recompiled under StormC 3 (as supplied by Blittersoft :)
     - it was reported by a user that this library would fail under
       OS 3.0 (not 3.1) because it uses WriteChunkyPixels().  So, it
       now uses the commented out code (since it was proven to work).
       Should work under 3.0 now :).
     - added CHK_C2POff()
 3.2 - CHK_C2POff() crashed so it's a dummy function now
     - added CHK_DrawChunkyWindow()
     - added CHK_QueryUseOS()
3.21 - minor bug fix in CHK_DrawChunkyWindow()
     - 3rd public release
4.0 (10-Mar-99)
 - ENORMOUS UPDATE
 - chunky buffers are now allocated on 16-byte alignments meaning there
   should be some noticable speed increases when read/writing to buffers
 - fixed CreateChunkyFromBitMap() - if the supplied bitmap was not a
   a native AllocBitMap() BitMap, CCFB() would have bombed
 - added CHK_CloneChunkyPort()
 - added CHK_SetBPen() - why was this missing I have no idea ;)
 - added optimisations to CHK_RectFill()
 - bigfixed CHK_DrawEllipse()
 - added CHK_ClearChunky()
 - optimised CHK_SetRast()
 - CHK_TextLength() fixed - now returns correct value
 - small problem conserning baselines in the text routines fixed
 - CHK_DrawChunkyChunkyArea() now supports DRAWMODES (JAM1, JAM2,
   INVERSVID, COMPLEMENT, and JAM2|(INVERSVID|COMPLEMENT)
 - added optimisations to CHK_DrawChunkyChunkyArea()
 - added CHK_CopyChunkyChunkyArea()
 - added CHK_FlipChunkyPort()
 - added scrolling support (CHK_BeginScroll(), CHK_EndScroll() and
   CHK_Scroll())
 - added ROTATION (CHK_Rotate())
 - added SCALING (CHK_Scale() smooths, CHK_SimpleScale() doesn't smooth)
 - added PALETTE routines (CHK_ConvertCMAP(), CHK_Set/GetRGB4/32(),
   CHK_LoadRGB32())
4.1 (16-Mar-99)
 - Fixed a bug in CHK_InsertChunky() (argh!)
 - CHK_LoadRGB32() copied data to the wrong place; fixed.
 - CHK_InitColours() didn't set the header; fixed.
 (17-Mar-99)
 - CHK_SetRGB4() was bugged (only excepted 0-15 due some broken shifting);
   fixed.
 (18-Mar-99)
 - Bah, had to remove CHK_Rotate() :( - if anyone wants to fix it, e-mail
   me.  There's a problem with recalculating the height for after the
   rotation.  I fixed the width, but only the height gives me grief.  So,
   it's been removed and now private.
 - CHK_Scale() gives problems - see autodocs; CHK_SimpleScale() is fine.
