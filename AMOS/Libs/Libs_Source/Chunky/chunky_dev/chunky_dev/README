using chunky.library.

*NEW* EXAMPLES ARE NOW INCLUDED!
      Some nasty bugs fixed...

CHUNKY GRAPHICS LIBRARY
Version 4.1 (18-Mar-1999)
Public Release 5

Welcome to the wonderful world of 8-bit chunky!

So, you want a standardised method of reading, writing and displaying chunky
data in your Amiga application?  Not too hot on the idea of using RTGMaster
or "rolling your own" methods?  Don't care for system hacks?  In that case,
you've downloaded the right thing!

This SHARED library for your compiler will handle everything to do with
<=256 colour chunky pictures.  Features:

* Shared library (can be used in any language)
* Transparent support for AGA/CGFX
* High-level and low-level commands available
* Draw from one chunky buffer to another (enhanced in V4)
* Uses RastPort's instead of BitMap's (and windows in V4)
* Text support (draw Amiga bitmap fonts onto chunky buffers)
* Features most of the basic graphics.library calls but works with chunky
  buffers
* All written in ANSI C (although AGA c2p/p2c stuff isn't)
* It's freeware!

And for version 4:
* 17 new functions in V4!
* Supports all RastPort drawing methods (JAM1, JAM2, INVERSVID, etc.)
* Ability to flip chunky buffers (horizontal, verticle, both)
* Scrolling of chunky buffers (any direction)
* 360 degree rotation!
* Infinate scaling (with or without smoothing)!
* RGB palette support

That list got your motor running?  Thought so...

See included documentation for more information.

WANTED

The c2p routines used are no way their best.  If you have flexible c2p/p2c
code that can use chunky buffers of any size and render at any position on
any screen size, do not hesitate to contact us.  We are looking to make
chunky.library the BEST chunky graphics system available.

FUTURE

V5 may see the following improvements:

* PPC support (PPC c2p code please :)
* 15/16/24-bit support (probably CGFX only)
* Layers (maybe)
* Display support (maybe)
* Your ideas

... but don't count on any of that happening :).
