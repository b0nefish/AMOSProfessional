This system shared library identifies your system and several IDs and
returns them in a human readable form. Currently implemented are:

expansions  The manufacturer and product ID of hardware expansions are
            translated into manufacturer name, board name and board
            class.

system      Your system is analyzed by identify.library. You can query
            static values, as e. g. Amiga model, Processor, OS version,
            Graphic OS (e. g. CyberGraphX 4), Audio OS (e. g. AHI) or
            available memory (Virtual Memory is also supported).

alerts      The cryptical alert codes can also be translated.

functions   Decodes the offset of a shared library into it's function
            name, provided you have got the .fd files.


Four example Shell tools are also included:

ListExp     Analyses your system, searches for expansion boards and
            optionally, shows what Commodities are available. This is
            an easy way to describe your system for bug reports etc.

Guru        Decodes a Guru number.

Function    Returns the name of the function that matches to the
            provided library name and offset.

InstallIfy  Gives Installer scripts access to the Identify hardware
            analyzer, e.g. to check if a PowerPC is present.

Other developer files (e.g. for BASIC) are available in the AmiNet.

With your help, I hope to get as much expansion names as possible.
So please send the name, manufacturer ID, product ID and board class
of all your expansions to: "rkoerber@gmx.de". You can get the IDs
with the included tool ListExp or the example program "expansions".
Thank you!
