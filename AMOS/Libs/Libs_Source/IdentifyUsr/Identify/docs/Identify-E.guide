Introduction
************

   The @{b}identify.library@{ub} has a rather long history.

   It all began when I got mad about all the System info programs only
showing the expansion boards as a number. So I wrote @{b}expname.library@{ub},
which you may already be familiar with.

   Later, expname could also identify the system's parameters (even if
it was wrong sometimes @{b};)@{ub} ). I still have new ideas for this library.
The only trouble is that the name does not fit any more.

   Well, now you have the second generation of the @{b}expname.library@{ub},
called @{b}identify.library@{ub}. It has been completely rewritten and expanded.
The conceptional flaws of the @{b}expname.library@{ub} have been removed, and a
lot of new features have been added.

   The library has currently these features:

   @{b}*@{ub} Converting manufacturer and product id into manufacturer name,
      product name, and product class.

   @{b}*@{ub} Converting the cryptical Amiga Guru codes into readable
     descriptions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Analyzing the system's configuration (system type, processor,
     memory, graphics and so on...).

   @{b}*@{ub} Converting shared library offsets into function names.

   Even if the library appears to be quite ready -- it is still far
from complete!

   I need your help! Please send manufacturer and product names and
IDs, your system's configuration, suggestions, bug reports and so on;
simply all you want to see implemented in the library.

ListExp
*******

   @{b}ListExp@{ub} is a small tool that was already included in the
@{b}expname.library@{ub} package.

   It describes the hardware components of the system. On the first
line it will write some hardware parameters (like CPU, Memory). After
that, all expansion boards will be listed (hopefully by name).

   By using the option @{b}FULL@{ub}, all currently used commodities are listed
too. The output is then useable for bug reports and similar.

   A further option allows to get the manufacturer name, product name
and class from manufacturer ID and product ID. Use the options @{b}MANUFID@{ub}
and @{b}PRODID@{ub} to do so.

   Finally, the option @{b}UPDATE@{ub} forces identify to re-check all hardware
information. Use this option e.g. after you started VMM.

   Example:
     > ListExp MANUFID=514 PRODID=9
     -- ListExp V9.1 -- by Richard Koerber
     
      Manufacturer: Commodore West Chester
      Product:      A2060
      Class:        ArcNet

   If some entries in the expansion list begin with a @{b}#@{ub} instead of a
name, you should send a copy of the @{b}ListExp@{ub} output and the description
of the missing board (manufacturer name, product name, product class)
to me. @{b}:-)@{ub}

   Please write me if an expansion name has been guessed. You can
easily recognize this by the class @{b}(guessed)@{ub}.

   It is also not possible to check out all combinations of Amiga
expansions.  If your hardware is not properly recognized, please write
me.

   @{i}Please note:@{ui} Some manufacturers, especially GVP and Phase 5,
assigned the same ID to different boards. @{b}identify.library@{ub} is prepared
and tries to differ these boards, anyhow it can't in any case decide
right.

   Example:
@{" ListExp FULL " System " ListExp FULL >CON:10/10///ListExp/AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT"}

Guru
****

   @{b}Guru@{ub} translates the cryptical alert code into a human-readable form.

   You may provide your alert code (all eight digits without any
symbols before or behind) as parameter. An example:

     > guru 81000005
     -- Guru V1.3 -- by Richard Koerber
     
      Alert Code: 81000005
      Type:       Deadend
      Subsystem:  exec.library
      General:    General fault
      Specified:  Corrupt memory list detected in FreeMem

   Or you can pass LASTALERT. In this case, the last alert code will be
examined.

   Please read the results like this::

@{b}Alert Code@{ub}
     This is the alert code that has been decoded.

@{b}Type@{ub}
     What kind of alert is it? It may be a deadend alert, or a recovery
     alert.

@{b}Subsystem@{ub}
     Which system caused the alert?

@{b}General@{ub}
     To what general class does this alert belong? In this case, it is a
     general fault which must be specified later.

@{b}Specified@{ub}
     What was the cause? This example shows that the memory list has
     been corrupted by a badly written program.

   Example:
@{" Guru 81000005 " System " Guru 81000005 >CON:10/10///Guru/AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT"}

Function
********

   You can use the tool @{b}Function@{ub} to decode the name of a function by
providing the library name and the function offset.

   The first argument is the library name, e.g. @{b}exec.library@{ub}. You may
also specify device or resource names here. All letters after the point
(including the point itself) are optional, but it is case sensitive.

   The last argument is the function offset to be decoded. It must be a
multiple of 6, but it doesn't need to be signed.

   Example:
     > Function exec.library -456
     -- Function V1.1 -- by Richard Koerber
     
      Library:    exec.library
      Offset:     -456
      Function:   DoIO

   This function requires the .fd files and an assign @{b}FD:@{ub} to the drawer
containing these files. The files must have the usual file name format,
e.g. @{b}exec_lib.fd@{ub}.

   Example:
@{" Function exec.library -456 " System " Function exec.library -456 >CON:10/10///Function/AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT"}

System
******

   @{b}identify.library@{ub} analyzes your system and provides the result to the
programs. If you read the different results, please keep this in mind:

@{b}SYSTEM@{ub}
     Describes your Amiga model, e.g. @{b}Amiga 4000@{ub}. Unfortunately, it is
     not possible to differ between Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000. In this
     case, @{b}Amiga (OCS)@{ub} or @{b}Amiga (ECS)@{ub} will be reported.

Fake Boards
***********

   Since the early beginning, a plagiarism of Identify does exist.  The
author confirmed me that he never took database entries from Identify.
To verify this, I added some faked expansions to the database.

   Every board database containing these entries, is a plagiarism of
Identify (with Manufacturer ID and Product ID):

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}BSC Oktagon 508@{ui} (MID 2092, PID 4) : this board does not exist

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Quadlite Computers Ltd.@{ui} (MID 2096) : this manufacturer does
     not exist

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}DelaComp@{ui} (MID 2163) : this manufacturer does not exist

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}VillageTronic PicassoIV Z2@{ui} (MID 2167, PID 20) : this PID is
     not allocated

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}UAS Interface Ltd.@{ui} (MID 5132) : this manufacturer does not
     exist

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}MacroSystem Germany ToccataPro@{ui} (MID 18260, PID 13) : this
     board does not exist

   I ask you to be lenient for this step, but it was just too tempting
to find out who copies data from Identify without prior permission...
@{b};-)@{ub} BTW, when I found out, I also had no mercy to copy data from their
databases without asking.

   The database size in the Identify readme did never count these fake
entries.  Since V11.1, these fake entries are removed.

Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

@{i}Emulation is detected properly, but I do not get information about the host system@{ui}
     Only AmigaXL provides information about the emulation host. Other
     emulators like UAE do not provide them.

@{i}An enforcer hit occurs while analysing the system.@{ui}
     This hit is necessary on some systems to read the last alert code.
     It is harmless.

@{i}The CPU/FPU clock isn't accurate.@{ui}
     Measuring the clock requires real Fast RAM for best results, else
     there may occur major faults.

@{i}The PowerPC clock isn't accurate.@{ui}
     This is a bug in the @{b}ppc.library@{ub}.

@{i}The PowerPC clock isn't available.@{ui}
     This occurs with some processors using WarpOS.

@{i}The system crashes at system queries (e.g. ListExp).@{ui}
