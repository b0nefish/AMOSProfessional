gtlayout.library V47.1 - GadTools layout toolkit

Copyright © 1993-1999 by Olaf `Olsen' Barthel

This is the first complete stand-alone release of my "gtlayout.library" user
interface creation and management tool kit. I'm sad to say that the library
has not seen much development in recent years: other projects I attended to
took most of my time. Some of the code found in this library made its way into
the Workbench 3.5 and 3.9 updates, but I never quite found the time to merge
the bug fixes back. Well, another time, another place, I may eventually get my
act together and take care of that.

This is now the most current release, even though it is now almost two years
old. There are fewer bugs in it than in the previous versions, but there are
also still bugs lurking in it, especially the text edit gadget. Take care.


I'm grateful for any enhancement requests, bug reports and especially bug
fixes. My mail address is:
