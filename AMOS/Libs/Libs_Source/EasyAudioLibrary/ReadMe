The EasyAudio Library, does exactly what it says on the tin, it provides
an easy (and i mean really easy) interface to the amigas sound capabilities.
It does all this in as system friendly fashion as possible, so your programs
will contain full error checking without you doing any of the hard work
yourself.

Most of the library calls are implemented as single liners, and the others
are as simple as i could make them whilst still giveing you some control.

Also provided is full gcc source code, so you should be able to compile it
yourself if you want. A full set of headers is provided so you can call the
functions from any compiler or assembler.

There a a few examples showing how you can use the functions, in C just to
prove how easy the interface is.
