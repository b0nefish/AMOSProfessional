*               V3.0  - Second major release of Storm-MESA
*
*******************************************************************************

 2.10.98        - first beta release of Storm-Mesa 3.0
                - V3.0 beta 1

 2.10.98        - Added two new tags for AmigaMesaCreateContext:
                  AMA_FAST and AMA_VERYFAST. These tags allow to select
                  a desired rendering quality. AMA_FAST tries to find
                  a compromise between quality and speed, while AMA_VERYFAST
                  doesn't care at all for OpenGL compliance. These tags will
                  be supported by the hardware driver.
 3.10.98        - Added a new environment variable MESA/NOHW, which
                  forbids the use of 3D hardware. Might be of use, if
                  100 percent GL compliant results are desired and the
                  hardware is unable to provide exact results.
                - Added EGCS/GCC Storm-MESA adaption to the archive
                  (see StMesa_Dev.lha/StormMesa/AMIGA/llibs/egcs)
 4.10.98        - New environment variables MESA/FAST and MESA/VERYFAST
                  can be used to force Mesa to render with less quality,
                  but maybe with higher speed. Will be supported by the
                  hardware driver.
                - Corrected some FD files
                - Stripped a few C++ comments from AmigaMesa.h to support
                  compilers which don't like them
 8.10.98        - New GLUT parameters -fast -vfast -nohw, which use the
                  corresponding new tags of AmigaMesaCreateContext.
                - New environment variable MESA/STATS enables hardware
                  rendering statistics

 9.10.98
   |
10.12.98        - Warp3D support completed
                - PPC implementations done
                - Added three new tags for AmigaMesaCreateContext/
                  AmigaMesaCreateVisual: AMA_NoDepth, AMA_NoStencil
                  and AMA_NoAccum to prevent Mesa to allocate the
                  corresponding buffers, if they aren't needed
                - Added more ASM optimiziations
                - Added support for all colormodels for direct
                  rendering/fullscreen mode

12.12.98        - Included the 'NewWPA8' patch in the StormMesa 3.0
                  distribution. This patch is necessary for AGA users
                  with OS 3.0.

13.12.98        - Added VBCC 68K/PPC adaption to the StormMesa archive
                  (see StMesa_Dev.lha/StormMesa/AMIGA/llibs/vbcc)

15.12.98        - All shared libs start with version number 1.0
                - V3.0

31.12.98        - Fixed some small bugs in the hardware driver
                - Found out, that demos using the accumulation buffer
                  in some cases don't work correctly with hardware
                  acceleration. Switch off the acceleration if you
                  want to see the correct results.

 1. 1.99        - Added optimizations for triangle strips/fans and
                  quad strips. This can accelerate hardware rendering
                  in some cases.

 2. 1.99        - Added more speed optimizations
                - Added new locking strategies for hardware rendering:
                  env:powerpc/lockmode
                  0 : default, indirect drawing, very system friendly, slow
                      for complex scenes
                  1 : lock per glBegin/glEnd, very slow, at the moment
                      completely useless
                  2 : full locking during the whole display function, freezes
                      the system for a long time, but is very fast

 9. 1.99        - Problem solved: some of the Viewperf tests mask out
                  the alpha plane, which resulted in clearing the
                  buffer using the Mesa core instead of the driver.
                  Corrected in gl. Leads to big performance improve
                  of some tests.
                - A lot of more optimizations added.

10. 1.99        - Still optimizing like hell. Added optimiziations
                  of linestrips/lineloops. StormMesa ist getting
                  faster and faster.
                - Window mode is now unsynchronized. It speeds up
                  a lot of demos without noticeable flickering.
                - New env variable 'MESA/SYNC' allows to enable
                  synchronisation for window mode
                - New env variable 'MESA/TRIPLE' enables
                  triple buffering. A lot of demos accelerate very
                  much, but triple buffering consumes much VRAM, so
                  800*600*16 is usually the max. resolution, when
                  using 3d hardware rendering on 8MB boards.

12. 1.99        - More optimizations in StormMesa and in the 3D
                  hardware driver in W3D gave another performance
                  boost. Note, that some of the newer optimizations
                  were only done for PPC.

16. 1.99        - Fixed a bug, which resulted in clearing the color
                  buffer with the wrong color, when calling glClearColor.
                  Only Hi/Truecolor modes in indirect render mode were
                  affected.

23. 1.99        - Added support for Warp3D V2. StormMesa doesn't work
                  with W3D V1 anymore.
                - More small bugfixes.

26. 1.99        - Changed internal vertex buffer size, leaded to
                  performance improvement.

30. 1.99        - GLUT now passes the 'char' parameter to the keyboard
                  callback function compiler-sensitive. To change
                  the behaviour to non-StormC, new linklibs for the
                  other 68K compilers have to be used.

31. 1.99        - Added new locking mode (mesa/lockmode = 3). It's a
                  compromise between mode 0 and mode 2, which achieves
                  a much better speed than mode 0 and a much better
                  system friendliness than mode 2. Mode 3 will be set
                  by default by the installer.

 2. 2.99        - An internal change leaded 'accidentally' to another
                  noticeable performance improvement.

 4. 2.99        - Added new link libs for vbcc 68k/egcs 68k to the
                  archive. These new link libs must be used whenever
                  the keyboard callback of GLUT is used in programs
                  compiled with these compilers (this only applies
                  to GLUT 68K).
                - Added link libs for egcs WarpUp.

 5. 2.99        - New library version numbers:
                  GLUT (68K/PPC): 1.2
                  GL (68K/PPC):   2.0
                - V3.1
