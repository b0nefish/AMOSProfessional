	rexxmathlib.library version 1.2 and 1.3
	=======================================

	This version is identical to the previous release. The only change is
that the version for the 1.3 math libraries now shows version 1.3, when you use
the AmigaDOS version command. Included in this archive is also version 1.2,
compiled and linked for AmigaDOS 1.2. It is called rexxmath1.2.library, and if
you want to use it, you must copy it to libs: as rexxmathlib.library.

	With the previous release:
	==========================

	This version is recompiled and relinked for use with the AmigaDOS
1.3 IEEE math libraries. How do you keep the various versions apart?
The size of the one for 1.3 is 7012 bytes. The previous release was some
13900 bytes, whereas the special release for the StarBoard II's 68881 was
8152 bytes. Which one to use? If you have AmigaDOS 1.3, use the one that's
7012 bytes long. If you have 1.2 or (heaven forbid) 1.1, use the 13900 byte
one. If you have 1.2 and a StarBoard II, AND a 68881 in its multifunction
module, use the special one after renaming it to rexxmathlib.library.
	This archive *only* includes the 7012 byte one. It can only be used
with the 1.3 IEEE math libraries.

	Documentation for the AmigaREXX math library, version 1.0.
	==========================================================

	In version 1 of the AmigaREXX math library the following functions
have been implemented. In column 1 you will find the function, in column 2
the calling sequence, and in column 3 some aliases. Column 4 has the allowed
ranges of the arguments that will not cause an error.
	The regular library is called rexxmathlib.library: it should work on
all Amigas. However, if you own a StarBoard II memory expansion with a 
Multi-Function Module plus 68881 math coprocessor, you can speed up your
REXX math by using the library rexxmathsbii.library instead. You will then 
also need the MicroBotics supplied IEEE libraries.
