Implemented ASL Tags / Functions:

		ASLFR_AcceptPattern
		ASLFR_RejectPattern
		ASLFR_UserData
		ASLFR_DoMultiSelect (and FRF_DOMULTISELECT)
		ASLFR_Window
		ASLFR_SleepWindow

Wrote patch "modifyleasl" that makes the Modiflye Requester
pop up in place of the ASL requester. Yet works only for
68k based software, it won't change the ASL requester that
is used on PPC natively. It will work for 68k based (emulated)
programs that run on PPC based Amigas though.
