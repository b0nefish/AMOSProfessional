                                About GZIP
                                ----------

This xpk compressor uses the general purpose data compression library ZLIB by
Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. It implements the compression technique used
by GZIP. Consult the README of ZLIB for further information (its provided in
the source directory).


                                Description
                                -----------

This new version of the xpkGZIP compressor retains compatibility with the old
xpkGZIP v1.0 compressor and requires at least 1.2 of the operating system. It
should work with every XPK version available. xpkGZIP was tested with V2 & V4
of xpkmaster.library on an A4000/060.
The library provides several compression modes yielding different compression
ratios (higher modes gain better compression results but are slower).

    Mode      Speed

   0 -   9    store (*no* compression; ZLIB feature)
  10 -  19    laziest
  20 -  29    lazier
  30 -  39    lazy
  40 -  49    calm
  50 -  59    average
  60 -  69    willing (default)
  70 -  79    greedy
  80 -  89    greedier
  90 - 100    greediest

                                 ----------

Following is a table briefly listing some comparative statistics for GZIP.
These were generated by xBench using an AmigaVision executable as data on
a non-standard XPK benchmark system (in this case my A4000/060 with 50Mhz).

This library was written in march and april of 1998 but not released since the
benchmarks were missing. I tried to create the benchmark result on a standard
test system but my A3000 is non-functional :-/ So I decided to get the package
out with tests done on my default system (an A4000/060). Another reason that
delayed the release was the missing documentation. This doc file is not very
pretty either but I hope its enough for people familiar with the XPK package.

The source for this xpk compressor is included for those who are interested.
The ZLIB interface was written entirely in C and can be compiled with SAS/C
or GCC. All provided libraries were created with GCC 3.3.

The source for two other xpk compressors is also included:

  xpkNONE - a simple sample library which does no compression
  xpkLHLB - a xpk interface for lh.library by Holger P. Krekel & Olaf Barthel
            (lh.library is not included!)


                              Version History
                              ---------------

1.2 (14/08/2003) - recompiled with GCC 3.3, now 11% faster compression!
    (09/04/2002) - removed all references to AbsExecBase
                   (should improve performance a lot!)
                 - updated to zlib 1.1.4

1.1 (24/10/1998) - rewritten from scratch (but compatible to 1.0)
                   - usage of memory pools for memory allocations
                   - new (improved) library initialisation
                   - updated to zlib 1.1.3

1.0 (21/08/1995) - initial version by Antonio Schifano using zlib 0.93
