                             ---------
Written by Asher Feldman

Note: Move requires the Copy, Rename, and Delete commands in your c directory.

Move 2.2a requires kickstart 2.04 or higher.   

Changes since 2.2 
-----------------
Move 2.2 didn't work right with the '*' wildcard, even after it was
activated.  This has been fixed, but in the process, Move grew to 
a huge 872 bytes.  :-(

What is it?
-----------
Move is a simple Un*x like "move" command.  It allows you to move files 
to and from any device or directory.  It performs the same function as the 
Move command on a directory utility, but from the CLI or Shell.  It can 
also be used as a Rename command.  Move supports true (rename style) moves
when moving files on the same device, while still allowing you to move files
across volumes.

Move will also allow you to move file links, and supports all standard 2.x
wildcards.

Usage
-----
                          Move [FROM] <arg1> [TO] <arg2>

(The [FROM] and [TO] are optional)

  <arg1> is the file you want to move.  It can contain wildcards, such as
"#?.lha".  Or "*.lha" if you are using a program such as Starburst to
enable the * wildcard on your system.

  <arg2> is the destination.  It can be a filename, directory or device.
  The "" wildcard may be used here, and stands for your current directory. 

  To move the file "readme" to ram: you would enter: (FROM and TO not needed)

                          Move FROM readme TO ram:


  To move all files that have the prefix "mod" to the directory DH0:Music
you would enter:

                          Move mod* DH0:Music

  To move "ram:readme" to your current directory you would enter:

                          Move ram:readme ""

  If you want to move every file in one directory to another, it would be:

                          Move <dir> <dir>

  Move can also be used to rename a file.  To change the name of the file 
"SONG.MOD" to "MOD.SONG" you would enter:

                          Move SONG.MOD MOD.SONG

  You can move multiple files without using wildcards as well. For example,
to move the files "lha", "uux", and "slect" to c: you could enter:
  
                          Move (lha|uux|slect) c:

To move them all back to the current directory you would use:

                          Move c:(lha|uux|slect) ""

General Info
------------
  There were already two "Move" utilities floating around in the public
domain that I knew of when I wrote this.  Both have built-in copy and
delete routines.  I thought this was a waste of space, especially for those
of us with very limited resources.  Thus I wrote Move, which takes advantage
of the "Copy", "Rename, and "Delete" commands already on everyone's system. 
This allows Move to be much smaller than the other "Move" utils, yet operate
just as fast, or faster in some cases.  Move will accept all the standard
2.0 wildcards (If you want to use * you must first activate it with a program
such as Starburst)

  Move will run much faster if you have the Copy, Rename, and 
Delete commands in residence.

                                 *     *     *

NOTE:

In the case of 

   Move yy xx

where the file xx already exists, xx will be overwritten without warning.
