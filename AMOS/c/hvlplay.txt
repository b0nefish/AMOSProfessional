NB: I have rebuilt the 040+ version as 020+. See the "extras" directory
    for the modified "Makefile".

hvlplay2007(hvlplay)-0.5
-------------------------- 

---

This is improved hvl/ahx player, it is able to play smoothly mods up to
14 channels in 16000 Hz on 68040. Player can also export songs to AIFF
or write them as RAW.

NEWS:
      [03-Jan-2009]   0.5   Engine has been updated, this is version 1.6
                            that fixes wierd distortions in AHX tunes.
                            Small fix has been applied to 'hvl_2007.c'
                            -piping was impossible when built with
                            '-DUSE_WRITE'. Thanks to Lorence Lombardo.

      [28-Dec-2008]   0.4-p ixlibrary ID has been changed, see this file:
                            http://megacz.back2roots.org/A2IXREGISTRY ,if 
                            you dont use 'ixemul' 48.3 then you have to find 
                            non-collisious ID in range of 0 to 99 and patch 
                            it with 'ixidset' from 'ixidtools'.

      [12-Sep-2008]   0.4   Updated to replayer 1.5, it seems this version 
                            is as fast as the one used in the first ver.
                            Player has been improved even more, from now 
                            on there is only one executable and three
                            flavours. Changes in the command line opts.
                            Thanks to Lombi for helping me hunting down
                            nasty bugs.

      [13-Mar-2008]   0.3   Updated the replayer engine to latest version 
                            so all the hvl tunes should play now with no 
                            probs. This replayer is a little bit slower 
                            than the one used in the previous version.

      [10-Feb-2008]   0.2   Removed AHI related bugs, increased extra
                            buffer factor from 48 to 128(multichannel hvl
                            tunes should now play smoothly on slow cpus).
                            Some other clean ups. Duration is now 
                            calculated by default(fast!).

NOTES:

[*]
'hvlplay.emu' is mainly targeted at users on some emulator, but may
be used on real Amiga as well, requires 68040+ with FPU,
mathieeedoubbas 37+, mathieeedoubtrans 37+.

'hvlplay.020' has precalculated waveforms and is the speed freak, but
yes its biiiiig, requires 68020(no FPU)+, mathieeedoubbas 37+,
mathieeedoubtrans 37+

'hvlplay.ix' is a hack that depends on 'ixemul', it is also quite fast
and can be great solution if your 'mathieee...' setup is old. It uses
shared library to hold replayer and waveforms that are generated only
once. It needs 68040+ with FPU. Important, this build may produce
samples that sound somewhat different, sensitive ear will catch that.

All builds require OS 2.04+, 1+ MiB of free memory, [ahi 4+]

[*]
This program doesnt like some exotic mixing frequencies like for example
11025 or 17640, this is due to its buffer organization, so you should use
these from template screen to avoid messy sound.

[*]
Output is 16 bit stereo, so real time output in some acceptabe quality
may be impossible on 68030 and less - lots of data to process. 68020/14
with fast mem is able to play smoothly 4 channel tunes in 6000Hz - very
poor quality, but at least works ;]

[*]
If you want to use 'AUDIO:' for output then here is few tips:

 - Dont set too large buffers anywhere.
 - Try to keep buffers cascaded, like small buffer feeds large buffer.
 - Use '-b<fct/n>' to adjust extra buffer in the player.
 - Calculate how much memory will be needed in 'AUDIO:',

    (frequency * bits * channum) / 8 = /buf=result
    (  24000   * 16   *    2   ) / 8 = /buf=96000
  
    You may even divide the result by 2, if you hear gaps.

 - Set the priority to above 0('changetaskpri 1') before starting.

[*]
If you hear gaps while playing through AHI then you may try to either
decrease the '-f<fhz/n>' and/or increase the '-b<fct/n>' or as a last
resort convert to a file and then listen.

[*]
'-l<num/n>' may not be able to loop subsongs that explicitly end - short
'ahx' subsongs mainly, so you have to use '-L<num/n>' and 'U<num/n>' but
this may not be as smooth as with '-l<num/n>'.

[*]
When building, the best results can be achived with GCC-3.4.0.

 ### hvlplay(2007/0.5) using hvl_replay.c(1.6) by megacz@usa.com
 *** template: hvlplay [options] <tune>

     options(example: -A0 or "-A 0"):

        -A<unit/n>  -  AHI Music Unit(0(def.)-3), this is default
        -a<file/k>  -  AIFF 16 bit output to a file
        -r<file/k>  -  RAW 16 bit output to a file or pipe
        -f<fhz/n>   -  Mixing frequency(4000-56000), works best with:
                       8000, 12000, 16000(def.), 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000
        -b<fct/n>   -  Auto buffer factor(1-128), def. 32, more=better
        -s<lev/n>   -  Stereo level(0=mono-4=st), ahx only, def. 2
        -l<num/n>   -  Loops single tune(0-126), can be used with -L
        -L<num/n>   -  Loops all tunes(0-126), can be used with -l
        -u<num/n>   -  Starts playing from this subtune(0(def.)-126)
        -U<num/n>   -  Starts playing only this subtune(0-126)
        -i          -  Dumps info only and quits(-u and -U can be used)
