 BREAKNAME, written by Kai Iske April 18. 1994
            This is PUBLIC DOMAIN; you may do with it whatever you like

If you change/republish/delete/sell the program or do anything similar, please
be so kind to keep my name within the program and all the other files, even
though you`re not obliged to, as for the definition of Public Domain

This is a simple addition to the C:Break command. BreakName may break
processes by issuing either

 a) the complete path + filename as shown by the C:Status command
 b) only the filename

BREAKNAME was written using DevPac 3.04....

!!! BreakName requires OS 2.x and up to run, BreakName is PURE !!!



-----------------------
What does BREAKNAME ???
-----------------------

As stated above you may break a CLI process by issuing it`s name or the
complete path+filename as shown by the status command. Why that, c:Break
may break processes as well ?

Assume you have a script which launches several processes and another script
for breaking those processes. How can you know which CLI number applies to
which process ??? Noone can tell, but you know the names of the programs
launched, don`t you ??? Well, this is it, simply use BREAKNAME in such a
script to remove those processes again. I use such scripts to launch and quit
my TeX environment (for example).


Commandline options :

  BreakName PROCESS/A,ALL/S,C/S,D/S,E/S,F/S

Explanation

  PROCESS : This is the name of the process to signal. You can either supply
            the complete path+filename here or simply supply the filename.
            The process search is handled case-insensitively.
  ALL     : Will tell BREAKNAME to send all signals (CDEF) to the process
  C       : CTRL-C will be sent to the process
  D       : CTRL-D will be sent to the process
  E       : CTRL-E will be sent to the process
  F       : CTRL-F will be sent to the process
  

----------------------------
