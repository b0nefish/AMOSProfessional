@{B}Function@{UB}

    Evaluate an integer expression and print the result. The result is
    written to standard output if not the TO switch are used which instead
    prints the result to a file. Using the switch LFORMAT, it is
    possible to direct how to write the result. Numbers prefixed by
    0x or #x are interpreted as hexadecimal and those prefixed by # or 0
    are interpreted as octals. Alphabetical characters are indicated
    by a leading single quotation mark ('), and are evaluated as their
    ASCII equivalent.

    VALUE2      --  The expression to evaluate. The following operators
                    are supported

    TO          --  File to write the result to
    LFORMAT     --  printf-like specification of what to write.
                    The possible swiches are:
                     
                    %xd --  hexadecimal output, width digit d
                    %od --  octal output, width digit d
                    %n  --  decimal output
                    %c  --  character output (the ANSI-character
                            corresponding to the result value)
                            
                    By specifying *n in the LFORMAT string, a newline
                    is output.
